              <h1>GALUNGAN</h1>
              <h2>14 April 2021 - 24 April 2021</h2>
              <p>Galungan, one of the most important Balinese festivals, is the culmination of celebrations held in honour of the creator and ancestral spirits.According to Balinese-Hinduism, the creator of the universe is Ida Sang Hyang Widi. During these celebrations, it is believed that spirits of the ancestors return to the earth, thus marking the start of a number of Balinese festivals.</p>
              <p>At the core of the festival is the celebration of good and the overcoming of evil; the victory of Dharma and the defeat of Adharma. The festival usually runs for around 10 days at various locations around Bali.With the return of these ancestral spirits to their former homes, the locals are expected to demonstrate kindness through making offerings and chanting prayers. Visitors touring Bali during Galungan will notice the tall bamboo poles that line the streets and roads. The bamboo poles locally referred to as ‘penjor’, are used to hang offerings as a kind gesture towards the spirits.
                The poles have colourful decorations that will often include fruits, flowers, and leaves from the coconut tree. The offerings, on the other hand, will consist of special foods, scented flowers, and woven palm offerings. These sacrifices are offered at home as well as at the local temples (referred to as pura). Women will be seen with their offerings carried on their heads, while the men will carry with them palm leaves to the temple.
                More importantly, a couple of days before and after the celebrations are accorded specific names, each dependent on the set of activities carried out in honour of the celebrations. The dates will vary from year to year simply because Balinese traditional ceremonies are observed in line with the Balinese calendar.
                At the end of the celebrations, the ancestral spirits go back to their home, and this is marked by offerings of yellow rice to mark the end of Galungan.</p>

              <h1>KARTINI DAY</h1>
              <h2>21 April 2021</h2>
              <p>Kartini Day is an Indonesian holiday celebrated in memory of Ajeng Kartini’s birth, a national heroine honoured for her efforts in fighting for women’s rights.Raden Ajeng Kartini was born on the 21st of April 1879 and is one of the country’s most recognisable faces.</p>
              <p>Kartini was born to a noble Javanese local who once toiled for the Dutch colonialists. Due to this, Kartini was exposed to the ideals of the western world at a very early age. Growing up, she was prohibited from getting an education because of her family’s nobility as well as age-old traditions. This led her to highlight the plight of locals suffering under the Dutch masters as well as the challenges faced by Indonesian women. It also birthed her desire to fight for women’s right to education in Indonesia.
              Even though she died in her prime at just 25 years, her efforts did not go unnoticed. Following the publication of her letters and the creation of the Kartini Foundation, the first Javanese girls’ school opened. The letters put together in the publication are letters she wrote to her international friends when she was secluded from school in anticipation of marriage.
              Today, Kartini Day is celebrated on the 21st of April every year and is also referred to as ‘Hari Ibu Kartini’ by the locals. Hailed as the country’s first feminist, Kartini is the symbol of women’s strength in a world that is fraught with gender inequality and the suppression of women’s rights. Kartini’s desire to see women freed from the shackles of repressive laws and beliefs made her a heroine. Her legacy lives on today, and this celebration is a testament to her resilience.</p>

          <h1>MEKOTEKAN RITUALS</h1>
          <h2>24 April 2021</h2>
          <p>The Mekotekan Rituals are part of the traditional Kuningan Festival that is celebrated to battle evil spirits that are said to attack Munggu Village.
          The Kuningan Festival is held every six months according to the traditional Balinese calendar. The festival’s rituals are diverse but aim at purifying the locals and the village. By eliminating any evil spirits, the locals are able to ensure that only good spirits remain.</p>
          <p>The ritual involves men re-enacting the Blambangan war by walking to temple carrying wooden sticks. They are sprinkled with holy water and proceed to lay the sticks into a huge pyramid. Some men will climb the pyramid to “face-off” with each other whilst cheered on by the large crowd.
          This ritual is believed to date back to the 17th century around the time of the Mengwi Kingdom. Legend has it that the Mekotekan ritual was conducted to welcome the kingdom’s soldiers back from the battlefield after fighting against soldiers from East Java’s Blambangan kingdom. On their way to the centre of the Mengwi kingdom, which was Munggu village, local residents cheered them as the winners of the war.
          This ritual was banned for a time during Dutch rule of Indonesia, around 1915, but the village resurrected this important cultural event and it remains today.
          Visitors are welcome to watch the ritual, though should not participate as it is considered disrespectful to the Balinese people.</p>

In order to honour this day, locals will usually make offerings at the temples as well as at their homes. The offerings consist of fresh foods, fruits and colourful flowers which is a true testament to the traditions that the locals have held on to over the years.
          Making offerings is often accompanied by the performance of various rituals. This includes bathing in holy waters as an act of cleansing, burning incense in order to chase away evil spirits as well as the use of flower petals and grains of rice.
          The occurrence of the full moon happens many times in any given year. For this reason, Purnama Kedasa is celebrated on multiple days every month. Depending on the time of your visit, you may be excited to find out that the full moon celebrations will be held around the time you are in Bali.

          <h1>IDUL FITRI FESTIVAL</h1>
          <h2>12 May 2021 - 13 May 2021</h2>
          <p>Idul Fitri Festival (also known as Lebaran) is a popular religious holiday in Bali. It is a unique holiday because its annual dates are determined by the Islamic Calendar.
          Idul Fitri marks the end of fasting in the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims across the world. The fasting which spans about 30 days, comes to an end following the sighting of the moon on the island. When the moon is sighted, Muslim religious leaders will make an announcement of the same so that all Muslims on the island break the fast at the same time.</p>
          <p>After this announcement, mass prayer sessions are carried out at the mosques as well as in public spaces across the island. One of the most notable things that visitors will notice is the coming together of families for feasting, with the signature dish known as ‘ketupat’. Local Muslims will also visit each other in the spirit of togetherness.
          In addition to this, Idul Fitri Festival is also marked with making donations to the less fortunate in society. These donations are locally known as ‘amal’. The festival is incomplete without asking for forgiveness from others for any time that one may have erred.
          Another fascinating thing that is characteristic of Idul Fitri festival is that typically, this is the time of the year when Muslims get new clothing. For this reason, many stores offer great deals during the month of Ramadan. Take advantage of these deals and get yourself great souvenirs from the beautiful island. You may also want to check out the restaurants for culinary specials offered on this special day.</p>

          <h1>WAISAK DAY</h1>
          <h2>26 May 2021</h2>
          <p>Waisak Day, also referred to as Vesak Day, is a national holiday observed by locals in both Bali and Indonesia as a way to honour and celebrate Buddha.
          As one of the common religions on mainland Indonesia, the celebrations attract pilgrims from all over the world as Vesak Day is the holiest day on the Buddhist calendar.</p>
          <p>At the core of Vesak Day is the celebration of the birth of Buddha, nirvana (which refers to his enlightenment) as well as Parinirvana (which refers to his death).
          The specific date of this celebration is determined by the Hindu Calendar and is scheduled on the day of the full moon in the fourth (Hindu) calendar month. For this reason, most of the Waisak Day celebrations fall in the month of May (using the Gregorian Calendar). This date was arrived at since, according to the Buddhist religion, Buddha died on the day of the full moon on the fourth lunar month.
          On the day of the celebrations, devout locals and foreigners who ascribe to Buddhist teachings will often gather at various temples at dawn. This is then followed by the raising of the Buddhist flag accompanied by the placing of offerings at the feet of Buddha statues.
          Visitors who are in Bali for the first time during these celebrations will be in awe of the numerous flowers and may wonder the reason behind this. The explanation is that just like beautiful flowers, life is amazing. As the flowers wither, so is it with life that is subject to destruction.
          In addition to paying homage to Buddha during Waisak Day celebrations, Balinese devouts are also expected to bring happiness to the people around them.</p>

          As a day when locals express their gratitude for life and life’s blessings, it is easy to understand why this day is considered to be a very sacred day for the Balinese.</p>
          <p>In addition to showing gratitude, locals are also expected to show compassion to one another and, in particular, to be charitable to the less fortunate in society.
          For foreigners, this is the perfect platform to get a feel of what Balinese lifestyle is all about as well as the daily activities that the locals are engaged in. In previous years, Tumpek Krulut has brought together tourists, the local community and religious leaders. In doing so, Bali prides itself as being culturally diverse.

          <h2>07 June 2021 - 12 June 2021</h2>
          <p>The Bali Arts Festival brings the island’s cultural scene to life for a whole month of daily exhibitions, performances and an array of art-related activities.
          The festival is held to celebrate arts in Bali, as well as bring together art lovers from across the country and beyond.</p>
          <p>The month-long festival will have you enjoying different performances all day long, with an array of exhibitions by different artists as well as classic dance performances and music.

          <h1>TUMPEK WAYANG</h1>
          <h2>07 June 2021</h2>
          <p>Tumpek Wayang is a traditional Balinese holiday and sacred festival of Hindus on the island which is celebrated every 6 months.This festival brings together puppeteers who perform purification rites (ruwatan) to purify their bodies both physically and mentally.</p>
          <p>Another reason why Tumpek Wayang is important for the locals is that it represents various transitions on the traditional calendar and is a connection between the following days: Saniscara, Kajeng, Kilown and Wayang. As a transitional point, this holiday plays a sacred role for locals.
          Another key aspect of these celebrations that make the day so special is that devout Balinese celebrate the day as one that marks the birth of the Lord Kala. Local mythology hints that the birth of Kala may have been the result of unplanned intercourse between Shiva god and Uma goddess, although it is important to note that there are several variations to this mythology.
          These variations, however, all point to the coming together of Shiva and Uma, which is why each celebration involves purification rites followed by the signature puppet show. This show is staged at the different temples, and is titled ‘Sapuh Leger’.
          Whenever you are in Bali during Tumpek Wayang, look out for the puppet shows staged at different locations. Interact with the locals to learn a thing or two about their culture.</p>

          <h1>TUMPEK KANDANG</h1>
          <h2>03 July 2021</h2>
          <p>Tumpek Kandang is a prominent day of celebration for Balinese locals as this is the time when locals show their gratitude for domestic animals. Typically, the celebrations occur every 210 days.
          Traditionally, Balinese locals used an array of domestic animals to help them get on with their daily activities. Some of these animals included bulls, cows, ducks, pigs as well as goats. The festival, which is also referred to as Tumpek Andang, is one of the ways in which locals show their appreciation for these animals.</p>
          <p>One of the most obvious ways in which this day is celebrated is through giving these domestic animals love and attention. Cows in Bali receive the best treatment than the other animals because they assist farmers when plowing the rice fields.
          It is not uncommon to see cows bathing in the river and even getting dressed up by the locals! Coconut leaves are designed to create a conical cap that is placed on the cow’s horns and pigs are embellished with colourful fabrics on their bellies.
          In addition to all these, the animals are given the best food as part of Tumpek Kandang. Locals will go out of their way to look for high-quality nutritious food for the animals. It is important, however, to take note that this is not a form of animal worship; instead, the locals see the celebrations as a way to appreciate the gods for the work done by these animals as well as the provision of food resources.</p>

          <h1>BANYU PINARUH</h1>
          <h2>29 August 2021</h2>
          <p>Banyu Pinaruh is one of the key events held during Saraswati celebrations in Bali. The event is celebrated every 210 days in accordance with the Balinese Calendar.
          At the core of this event is the celebration of the virtue of knowledge and the role it plays in the present day world.</p>
          <p>The name Banyu Pinaruh is derived from two words: Banyuh, which translates to ‘holy waters’ and Pinaruh which means ‘knowledge’. A combination of the two words means that locals regard this as the celebration of the sacred waters of knowledge. This is derived from the fact that locals believe that Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, gave knowledge to the human race on this particular day.
          As a cultural ritual that is part of the traditions in Bali, the event is characterised by gathering of the locals in the early morning at any of the following locations: the river banks, the shores of the lake or at the beach. Taking a bath at these locations is believed to rejuvenate the body and get rid of the mundane feeling that comes from day to day activities.
          This is often accompanied by the offering of sacrifices prior to the bath session. Tanah Lot Temple, one of Bali’s most famous sea temple, is a favourite destination for Banyu Pinaruh, so visitors who would like to join the locals can make a stopover at this intricate sea temple.
          Tanah Lot Temple is a unique temple that is perched on a rocky outcrop over the sea. Located near North Kuta, this temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Bali. To get to the temple, you will walk through a number of stalls selling all kinds of food, drinks and souvenirs. Be prepared to haggle for souvenirs, as the prices are “tourist prices” and can often be negotiated down.</p>

          <h1>MAKEPUNG BULLOCK RACES</h1>
          <h2>TBA July 2021</h2>
          <p>Bull racing is an age-old tradition across generations in Bali and the Makepung Bullock Races (aka Negara Bull Races) is one of the most popular bull races on the island.
          The name of this bullock race is derived from the local Balinese word, ‘kepung’ which translates to ‘chasing’. The word is comparable to ‘steeplechase’, and simply means that it is a race that involves bulls ‘chasing’ each other in the race.</p>
          <p>The unique thing about this race is that it brings to life the agrarian way of life and effortlessly blends it with the island’s traditional cultures to create a modern-day tourist attraction. This event also has a great effect on other important facets of the island’s economy including agriculture and farming. The latter is evident with an increase in the number of locals rearing bullocks to participate in the annual Makepung Bullock Races.
          There are different tracks scattered across the district to allow for the initial phases of the racing competition. As the race’s progress, the farmers get to converge at a pre-determined central location. This meeting is referred to as sekaa makepung, and is marked with different festivities.
          On the day of the finals, enthusiastic visitors will gather to cheer on the racing bullocks. In addition to the racing, visitors also get treated to a unique show known as the ‘buffalo fashion show’. During this show, these beautiful animals are dressed in animal clothing embellished with ornaments before been allowed to compete in the best-dressed section.
          Makepung Bullock Races run each year and kick off early, usually by 7:30am, so if you would like to attend, make your way to the circuit in good time. The dates for each year’s event vary, however, the heats take place each month on a Sunday morning from July to November.</p>

          <h1>SOMA RIBEK</h1>
          <h2>08 August 2021</h2>
          <p>Soma Ribek is a key festival in Bali commonly referred to as Soma Pon Wuku Sprott. The festival is all about appreciating food and occurs every 210 days.
          It is an obvious fact that food is an integral part of daily life and the Balinese Hindus seek to show their gratitude for the availability of food on the island.</p>
          <p>Since rice is the staple food in Bali, it is quite obvious why this would be the symbolic offering of choice. To mark Soma Ribek, locals will stop grinding, pounding or selling rice in honour of this day. The locals thank God for the food available in their lives and pray to Dewi Sri (the Goddess of prosperity) to give prosperity.
          The feast is closely tied to the Saraswati Feast. As a result, there are divine teachings that the devout locals will adhere to. These teachings will involve gaining knowledge about sustaining life with rice and rice products and this is key for the community because the abundance of rice symbolises prosperity in the community.
          The offerings, divine teachings and symbolic acts are a fundamental part of Soma Ribek. While foreigners should not take part in the rituals, it is important that they respect the customs of the day, including understanding the unavailability of rice in some areas.</p>

          <h1>UBUD JAZZ FESTIVAL</h1>
          <h2>14 August 2021 - 15 August 2021</h2>
          <p>The Ubud Village Jazz Festival is a huge community concert held over two days in Ubud, the cultural capital of Bali.
          The festival traces its humble beginnings to 2013 following the gathering of artists in an intimate gathering. The very first event featured 20 performances on three platforms over a period of 2 days, bringing together 100 musicians.</p>
          <p>Today, the festival features various types of jazz music by international performers and also runs workshops for budding artists. During these workshops, visitors can learn more about jazz music and hone your skills with jazz experts.
          Ubud Village Jazz Festival, an annual event, is made possible by the support of the local Ubud community. Finances from the festival are sourced through sponsors, advertisers, as well as ticket fees paid by attendees.
          Tickets are available online closer to the event, and those buying online will receive a voucher which can be exchanged at the ticket booth on location.
          You can get to Ubud by taxi or private car from Kuta and it will take around 90 minutes each way. There are many metered taxis in Bali, particularly in the tourist areas of Denpasar, Kuta, Seminyak, Sanur, Ubud and Nusa Dua. Finding a taxi is extremely easy as taxis usually crawl along the main road beeping at tourists. Make sure to get a taxi with a meter, look for the Bluebird Group taxis, otherwise ensure you negotiate a price before getting in. As a guide, a 5km trip will cost around 40,000-50,000 IDR ($4-$5 AUD or $3-$4 USD).
          A trip to Ubud can cost up to 400,000-500,000 IDR ($40-$50 AUD) in a taxi. It is, therefore, cheaper to just hire a private driver for the day so that they will wait for you and do the return trip.</p>

          <h1>BALI KITE FESTIVAL</h1>
          <h2>TBA August 2021</h2>
          <p>The Bali Kite Festival is an annual festival held on the island from July to October. The event highlights Bali’s unique culture, drawing thousands of visitors each year.
          The timing of the kite festival in July and August is key, as this marks the start of the windy season in Bali. In addition to this, both months are peak season for tourists, which means that attendance is full, making it a fun and interactive festival.</p>
          <p>If you would like to enjoy kite-flying, interacting with the locals as well as the sun and sea, then make your way to Padanggalak. Padanggalak is a coastal region north of the tourist town of Sanur.
          For those who would like to plan in advance, it may be a little hard, as the dates are scheduled in accordance with current weather conditions. Therefore, it is best to have a general idea of the dates and then check with your hotel when you arrive to see if they are aware of the confirmed dates.
          Once the dates are set, locals gather to compete with foreigners in kite flying. If you head down to the beach to watch or take part, you will see a sky filled with kites of all shapes, sizes and colours soaring above the crowded beaches.
          History has it that the festival started off as a colourful fanfare to thank the gods for bountiful harvests and fertility, but has since grown to become one of the most remarkable events on Bali’s event calendar. Prizes are given to the most distinct and creative kites. If you love kites and are a fan of the outdoors, then the Bali Kite Festival is perfect for you.</p>

          <h1>INDONESIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY</h1>
          <h2>17 August 2021</h2>
          <p>Indonesian Independence Day is a public holiday in Indonesia which is celebrated on the 17th of August each year and marks Indonesia’s independence from Dutch colonial rule.
          Interestingly, while the country gained independence from the Netherlands in 1945, it was not until 2005 that the colonial rulers officially accepted the date. Since then, the country has held celebrations every year as a way to recognise the progress that Indonesia has made over the years.</p>
          <p>This national holiday is celebrated in Bali with various festivities including parades, community events and cultural and art exhibitions.
          The Presidential Palace is decorated with red and white colours in recognition of the Indonesian flag and the community comes together for clean up of the streets and residences. Each year there is a flag-raising ceremony which is televised live on TV nationally and is attended by the President, Vice President and military personnel.
          Traditions also include eating Indonesian crackers (known as ‘krupuk’) and cooking competitions. One of the most popular activities is the Panjat Pinang. This is where a palm tree trunk is erected and covered in grease. Prizes are hung from the top and people are challenged to climb to the top. If you make it to the top, you win the prize.
          Visitors to Bali during this celebration can join in on the festivities by trying the local foods and watching the parades, cultural dances, air show and marching bands. This day is very important to the Indonesian people and people visiting during this time should treat these celebrations with the utmost respect.</p>

          <h1>SARASWATI DAY</h1>
          <h2>28 August 2021</h2>
          <p>Saraswati Day is held in honour of Saraswati who is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning is held every 210 days.
          Saraswati is said to help the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to create, maintain and regenerate the universe. Thanks are given to her on this holy day.</p>
          <p>The name Saraswati is obtained from two local Balinese words: sara and swaandthi. The two words translate to mean ‘the one who has all knowledge’ or ‘the one who gives meaning’. In some areas, the name translates to ‘one who is as a stream of knowledge’ who is thought to give understanding to those who are keen on learning.
          The symbol of this goddess is a pretty four-armed goddess illustrated as playing the zither and holding up scriptures. This illustration is demonstrative of the thirst of knowledge.
          The hallmark of the celebrations is the provision of offerings by locals regardless of their location: whether at school, at home, at the office, in the farm or in the temples. These offerings are varied, but the one similarity between them is the fact that the offerings are often placed in books and in the middle of pages with holy scripture. This is done in light of the celebration of knowledge, which one can get from these books.
          Also, it is typical to see Balinese avoid reading or writing in books on this day as all the books are offered up to Saraswati. As evening falls, religious books are read in temples or at home to honour the goddess.</p>

          <h1>SABUH MAS</h1>
          <h2>31 AugusT 2021</h2>
          <p>Sabuh Mas is a Balinese holiday set aside for the worship of Mahadeva where they ask for blessings of various precious metals, jewellery and for wealth and occurs every 210 days.
          It is interesting to note the derivation of the name’s meaning; Sabuh means ‘belt’, while Mas translates to ‘gold’ in the local language. As such, the direct meaning of this holiday is ‘gold belt’.</p>
          <p>Locals honour the significance of this day by making various offerings to a deposit box or by presenting their jewellery box to a temple in honour of the day’s celebrations.
          The aim of doing this is to show appreciation to Mahadewa for one’s property and earthly possessions. It is all about showing gratitude for one’s clothing, jewellery, home, cash, gold and silver. It is also a reminder of the need to be prudent when spending money.
          This mantra is derived from the belief of Sabuh Mas that stipulates that cloth, gold and other possessions are the fourth most important thing in human life. These activities are followed by the local people asking for divine guidance in acquiring their wealth and property.
          This sacred day is observed every 210 days and is part and parcel of the Saraswati celebrations. Various rituals are held at different temples across Bali, and visitors can get to be part of Sabuh Mas by respecting the locals’ religion and adhering to religious ethics when visiting the temples. This includes wearing appropriate attire such as a sarong to cover your legs and ensuring tops cover shoulders and midriffs.</p>

          <h2>TBA Fall 2021</h2>
          <p>The 10th Bali International Triathlon will be held again in 2021 at Sanur Beach and the surrounding area.
          The event gets larger every year, so those wanting to participate are advised to register early to avoid disappointment.</p>
          <p>This triathlon is one of the showcases on Bali’s sporting calendar and will travel through some of the less populated areas in Bali.
          Generally, the swim portion of the race begins at sunrise followed by the bike sprint and a road race through the streets of Bali’s sleepy villages.
          There are categories of races for both men and women, individual and team relay races. There is an Olympic Distance Event which consists of a 1.5km swim, 40km bike ride and a 10km run; a Sprint Distance Event which consists of a 500m swim, 20km bike ride and a 5km run; and there is also a 5km fun run.

          <h1>PAGERWESI</h1>
          <h2>01 September 2021</h2>
          <p>Pagerwesi is a Balinese ceremony celebrated every 210 days according to the traditional Balinese calendar, just three days after the Saraswati festivities.
          The name of this ceremony is obtained from two local words: pager and wesi. Pager is a local word that translates to ‘fence’, while wesi means ‘iron’. The full word’s literal meaning is iron fence and is when the Balinese people strengthen their minds and souls against evil forces.</p>
          <p>The festivities are held in honour of Siva, the third deity in Hindu religion. Siva is honoured as the god who protects the universe, and locals will pay their respects in order to invoke prosperity as well as pray for protection.
          The date of the festival coincides with the celebration of Saraswati and the reason for this is that after the celebration of knowledge and divine inspiration during Saraswati, Pagerwasi is held to protect and shield this knowledge and inspiration from evil forces.
          One of the most significant activities that the locals will engage in is the fortification of their individual homes and businesses in a bid to keep away dark spirits. Offerings are made by families and villages in order to be protected from evil.
          It is also common for locals to make offerings at various cemeteries as a way to celebrate those who have not been cremated. The hallmark of these celebrations is the colourful festivities at numerous temples across Bali. For visitors, look out for the ‘penjors’, tall bamboo poles strapped to raise offerings, making this a striking similarity between Pagerwesi and Galungan, both important ceremonies in Bali.
          If you decide to head to the temples, make sure you wear the correct attire including sarong to your ankles and make sure to cover shoulders and midriffs.</p>

          <h1>TUMPEK LANDEP</h1>
          <h2>11 September 2021 - 12 September 2021</h2>
          <p>Tumpek Landep is a Balinese festival that is held to celebrate divine inspiration as a way to honour the god of taksu.
          The name of the festival is derived from two words: tumpek and landep. Tumpek translates to ‘nearby’ in the local dialect, while the latter means ‘sharp’. This manifests itself in the festival where offerings are made for objects that are made of metal.</p>
          <p>Tumpek Landep was originally a ceremony to pay homage to items of ancestral heritage such as daggers and spears. However, over time the meaning of this ceremony has somewhat changed and locals bless all items made of metal including cars, motorcycles, computers and even refrigerators.
          One of the fundamental rituals carried out during Tumpek Landep is the act of cleansing to ensure that devotees are pure to partake of the celebrations. This cleansing is carried out in honour of different ancestral spirits and is also a way to pay homage to the departed.
          The celebrations are marked at various temples across the island. Families with dedicated shrines at their homes can also make offerings there. This is done to invoke prosperity and goodwill from the god Shiva Pasupati. Local artists engage in this festival as a way to ask for inspiration that will make their art relevant to society.
          At the core of Tumpek Landep is the recognition of the role inspiration plays as pertains to divinity. Visitors in Bali will be awed by the various ceremonial acts that the locals observe as a way to commemorate this festival.</p>

          <h2>16 October 2021</h2>
          <p>Tumpek Uduh, also referred to as Tumpek Pengatag or Tumpek Wariga, is an event dedicated to Sanghyang Sangkara, the god of food on Bali Island.
          This event is held 25 days prior to Galungan, a significant festival held once after every 210 days. On this day, offerings are made to this god in order to invoke blessings on the land. These offerings constitute crops and farm products from the many plantations scattered across the island.</p>
          <p>The locals will usually engage in this traditional festival by placing their varied offerings at the base of select trees on the island. Some will even go a step further and prepare porridge which is then poured on the trees.
          The aim of this ritual is to remind the locals of the importance of plants and natural vegetation as a source of food for the locals. The idea behind Tumpek Uduh also revolves around pleasing Sanghyang Sangkara and asking for guidance on the cultivation, growth, harvesting and preservation of the plants.
          Visitors who spend time on the island around this period will be happy to discover that the festivals also promote an appreciation for a harmonic living of human beings across the world.
          The best comparison to this day would be the celebration of Earth Day globally. Balinese locals grasped the importance of conserving nature and preserving the environment well ahead before the rest of the world figured it out. This passing on of traditions from one generation to another is another marvel for visitors who would like to enjoy Tumpek Uduh.</p>
